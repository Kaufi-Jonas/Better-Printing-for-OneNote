# Better-Printing-for-OneNote
This project aims to deliver an improved printing experience for OneNote when printing handwritten pages.

### Motivation
When you try to print handwritten text that is larger than a single page of your printer, OneNote just cuts the pages where the bounds are. Often times, text gets split in half and also, if that happens, text is duplicated to the next page. To solve this you have to manually add margins into your handwriting, then look at the print preview again, add another margin, and so forth. This application allows you to easily add page breaks as well as remove a hole section. The weird page splitting that OneNote uses is automatically reversed when you load the document.
