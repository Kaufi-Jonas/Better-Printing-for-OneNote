# Better-Printing-for-OneNote
This project aims to deliver an improved printing experience for OneNote when printing handwritten pages.

### Motivation
When you try to print handwritten text that is larger than a single page of your printer, OneNote just cuts the pages where the bounds are. Often times, text gets split in half and also, if that happens text is duplicated to the next page. To solve this you have to manually add margins into your handwriting, then look at the print preview again, add another margin, and so forth. This application allows you to easily add page breaks as well as remove a hole section. When you select the printer you want to print to, its device specific page borders are added into the view, so what you see is what you get. There are also other features included that you might find useful.
